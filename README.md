# Deploy ML Model

## Project description

In this repo, I learn to deploy a Machine Learning (ML) model in the cloud. Doing so requires the following steps:

- Create a ML model.
- Make an API to make predictions
- Set up a virtual environment
- Dockerize the application
- Set up & configure an AWS EC2 instance
- Test the service

### Create a ML model

In my case, this is a basic `LogisticRegression` algorithm from `scikit-learn` on the Iris dataset. The algorithm and the data don't matter much in this project as this is the part I am most comfortable with. I (almost) have a Master's degree in Data Science & Artificial Intelligence so this is my day-to-day job. On the deployment part, however, I am way more uncomfortable. I never learnt such things as dockerizing, setting up instances or using the cloud.
